## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

This was a pretty straight forward design, so not a lot in terms of new concepts that I had to research, but just continued practice of my CSS skills. This did end up feeling like a design that actually did not work very well starting off with a mobile-first workflow. With the way that the different sections changed between screen sizes, I feel like I ended up writing more CSS for the large screen breakpoint than I would have if I worked from a small screen breakpoint.

### Continued Development

I am really comfortable using CSS custom properties, and as I was going through this project I started to realize how much extra work I was giving myself by not using them as efficiently as they could be used. This is definitely something I am going to work on on future projects.
